otta talk to me/You wanna get in? Put a sucker's head out/Sound a little hot for you, boy? Then, toy, get out/Syndicate mob ain't nothin but hardened
crooks/You try to diss, your butt is on a meat hook/Want some of me? You're on a mission/Bad move, you end up missin//Let's get it straight for the '8
9 tip/Randy Mac is clockin a stupid grip/On the party track I'm cold lampin/But when the Syndicate rolls I be jackin/You thought I fell off, I ain't e
ven slipped/The Mac is cuttin records and punks are gettin ripped/Gangster I am, bust the lyrics like a drive-by/You wanna sleep? Well, it's lights ou
t, beddy-bye//Notorious Asiatic, tough, talented/A power entertainer/Catapultin above the top/Nat The Cat, too swift to be stopped/I'm like Jordan, a
team player on a solo flight/Lookin down on MC's faces full of fright and fear/I slam dunk a rap through their ear to hear/Heureka! I just struck a pl
atinum fame/In the game things'll never be the same/Because money changes everything//Once again comin at you hyper/Donald D the Syndicate Sniper/Bost
on Strangler, Charles Manson/No matter what killer I mention, keep dancin/Five Fingers Of Death, Fists Of Fury/St. Valentine's Day Massacre on a jury/
Wanna convict me for kickin black on wax/I walk the street with a battle axe//Life ain't nothin but a piece of existence/Cause when you die, you'se a
past tense/So I like to live my life like a big carnival/Get drunk, act like an animal/I like the rock'n rolll, the funk, the jazz and hip-hop/Suckers
 get loud, I drop em/I like /I'm Bronx Bob, bring the beats and I'm//Black stallion, knockin on concrete walls/Standin tall, rappers in my face, they
stall/Stutter, softer than melted butter/There's no other word, go ask your mother/Hard solid as your city /Born in Brooklyn, can tell by the way that
 I walk and talk/Strollin with a slight limp/Flyer than any big city pimp//Gold, girls, cold cash/On the mic Shaquel Shabazz/Supreme, the Lord, the G-
o-d/Down with the Syndicate posse/It's you we rule without a tool/Mathematics in effect, it's time to school/I'm the principal and knowledge is the ke
y/Shaquel in the place to be//I climb a mountain top with just one rope/Get to the top of the stairs and say a rhyme that's dope/Cause I'm a cliffhang
er, no, I ain't a stranger/Yo, I'm Toddy Tee, and I'm a Compton banger/Wanted by the F.B.I. for transport of/Sucker MC's across the Syndicate borders/
No, they can't give me no time, cause it's my rhyme/Everlast, get funky for me one time//Everlast is in effect gettin big respect/Then I collect big c
hecks/1's, 5's, 10's and 20's/A 100 g's and I'm pullin honeys/Left and right, day and night/You gotta see it to believe it, it's quite a sight/They're
 all on the tip to get a sip/Of this poetic performer that's fully equipped//Y'all played yourselves right in front of the mic/Moved your body so that
 the feelin was right/But if you get lost scream out and admit/That the beat's too fast, slow it down or I quit/I'm not the kind to give you a call/To
 stop on a rap that I lead, so I pause/I give you 5, 4, 3, 2, 1/If that ain't enough, sit down till we're done//Syndicate scorned, you act obedient/Ti
red of your fish rhyme ingredients/Black on black while styles /of brothers that's gotta be/Circlin cyphers into molecules/Takin over your space, that
's illogical/The vocal chords on a board with 24 tracks/Get away from the break gotta rap//Syndicate posse growin, goin out of control/You say we're w
eak? This record's shippin gold/Power, strength, my posse got unity/We stick together and we're soon to be/In your town, we gonna bring the roof down/
Ice-T and the syndicate underground/No selll-outs, cause it's caps we peelin/Girls we love em, and shows we steal em//Knowledge and wisdom, it's a mys
tery/I drop science for the ones who know it's me/You say I'm dope, cool, it makes sense/I ain't conceited, I'm just convinced/Strapped for the attack
 Randy Mac is rollin/The mic, the mixer, then the show is stolen/The pimp, the player, hustler kicker/Watch your girl, cause I stick her//Nat The Cat,
 my man will rap when I'm playin the back/Some think my stage presence is low, I think it's loud/Enough to see me flowin and showin/Go psycho breakin
backs like bolo/Give me the mic, a metamorphis ignite/I break down on a cat stand, I kill ya like a hitman/And come out kickin with the /Rockin on a r
appin rampage/In control of the stage//There's a mouse in my house, so I bought a cat/The cat ran away, cause now there's a rat/I'm on the attack with
 my baseball bat/That one rap brought many of us back/All through my house I set up traps/It seem like the rats have a map/But nowadays I don't know h
ow to act/So now I feed the rats crack//Back and I'm statin the fact/I know you're waitin for a rap/To make you get up and start to clap/For Bob, a Br
onx Syndicate style/More bounce to the ounce and trizzy to the file/'79 the time I was inclined/To get smooth and prove that I can rock a funk rhyme/H
ey yo, ice-cube chillin/Cause we got the gats and knack to see the kids top billin//Impressionalist, not a ventriloquist/Don't hang out with suckers w
orth less than piss/Suckers can all come kiss the tip/Of my knob when I aim I don't miss/Aim it to suckers that come around jockin/On my tip when on t
he radio my recors be rockin/Don't come frontin askin me for a pound/You ain't invited means you simply ain't down//Wake up it's time to be noticed/I'
ma do this, I'm gonna show this/Beat to be mathematical/Syndicate's in the house, let's get radical/Bum rush the show and grab the mic/Syndicate's chi
lllin out tonight/They let me loose and now it's war/ let the rhymes roar//Grab a partner and hit the dancefloor/Cause I'm back to rock for you once m
ore/I don't worry about what he said or she said/As long as what's said-said is done-done in my bed/The Juvenile Committee's on my side/And I'm kickin
 knowledge on a natural high/And I'm feeling strong/Yo, take this mic and get the party on//This is mortal combat, there ain't no comeback/You're tryi
n to get with me but you don't know where I'm at/Cause in this world there's no bombs or guns/Just a microphone, metaphors, words and puns/Sentences a
nd phrases, no clubs or razors/No mercy for a sucker that wages/War, I'll take the floor, even the score/Grab the microphone and proceed to roar//Are
y'all set, all prepared to start/Move in close cause here comes the dope part/By the way, I'm the Taste, if tracks/Could talk but they - but here go t
he facts/Brace yourself, you shoulda grabbed a grip/Protect your clan cause we're about to trip/Bass reflex, the kicks that drive, divide/The weak fro
m the rest can't survive//Syndicate's housin all competition/We paralyze a physical powerful vision/But savage ignorants pop that's ignorant listen/Di
vine is no time for style/And I rock your grey matter with a smile/Cause I'm the rhyme thriller with dimensions of flavor/The knack - stylistic black/
/The reason we're bustin these raps are what?/To make all you wack MC's shut up/You're always buyin rap records jammin def beats/Then dissin rap artis
ts out in the streets/You always say our jams are wack but yours'll be tight/But you never been near a studio in your life/You see, disrespect is your
 last resort/You're like Howard [Name], you never played this sport/But you're always talkin mess bout how it should be done/And when we ask to hear y
our record you never made one/So this message goes to amateurs and pros alike/We're the MC's that cold be doggin the mic/You may be good but there's n
o one better/We rock you so cold, you need a cashmere sweater/Fight dirty in the pit when combat is on/We always attack before attacked upon//Yeah, Rh
yme Syndicate, we in here/We tossin it up/I got my man Everlast in the house/Tossin it up, youknowwhatimsayin/Kid Jazz and Bango couldn't be here/But
we gon' to' it up for them anyhow/Wherever you are you're a star/Rhyme Syndicate blowin up like napalm/I got my man Chilly Dee deejayin on the set/And
 the one and only DJ Evil-E, we in here/Yo, we outta here like last year/Rhyme Syndicate/We gotta do it like the alphabet and a-b-c ya/Yeah//Everlast/
Everlast in full effect/Where's my gold record?/Where's my record?/Where's my record?//Divine Styler with Physical Poets, look out//Microphone King Do
