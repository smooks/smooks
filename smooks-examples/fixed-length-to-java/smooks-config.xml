        Smooks makes binding of Fixed Length records very easy. Here
        we create a List of Customer objects...

	    Note: We use the functions (since 1.3) in the field declaration to manipulate the field data as soon as they are read.
	          Take a look in the Smooks manual for a list of all available functions
