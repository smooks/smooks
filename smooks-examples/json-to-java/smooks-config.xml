    <!--
    Configure the JSON Reader to read the message stream into a stream of SAX events.

    The input message contains whitespaces in the key names. Whitespaces aren't allowed in
    element names of the SAX event stream. To solve this we replace the whitespaces with dashes (-).

  	Another special case is that the is a key called date&time. The ampersand isn't allowed in a
  	element name of the SAX event stream. We can solve this in two ways. Configure the reader, with
  	the illegalElementNameCharReplacement parameter, to replace all illegal characters with
  	a character that is allowed. In this example however we solve it by mapping the "date&time" key
    to the "date-and-time" name.

    There are more settings to for the org.smooks.json.JSONReader.
    Take a look at the Javadoc of the class for alle the possible parameters.
