== Smooks Release process

This section describes the process to create a release for Smooks.

=== Generate a keypair for signing artifacts

To deploy to Nexus it is required that the artifacts are signed. This
section describes how to generate the keys for signing:

Install http://www.openpgp.org/resources/downloads.shtml[pgp]. For
example, using Mac OSX:

....
brew install gpg
....

Now, generate the keypair:

....
gpg --gen-key
....

List the key to get the public key identifier:

....
gpg --list-keys
/Users/username/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
----------------------------------------
pub   2048R/DEA94886 2014-02-27
uid                  Firstname Lastname <firstname.lastname@xyz.com>
sub   2048R/AB98C664 2014-02-27
....

For others to be able to verify the signature, in our case Nexus must be
able to do this, we to make the public key avaiable:

....
gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-keys DEA94886
....

In the example above we are using the _pub_ identifer.

==== Project configuration

===== Distribution management and authentication

In order to configure Maven to deploy to the OSSRH Nexus Repository
Manager with the Nexus Staging Maven plugin you have to configure it
like this

[source,xml]
----
<distributionManagement>
  <snapshotRepository>
    <id>ossrh</id>
    <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
  </snapshotRepository>
</distributionManagement>
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.sonatype.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>nexus-staging-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>1.6.7</version>
      <extensions>true</extensions>
      <configuration>
        <serverId>ossrh</serverId>
        <nexusUrl>https://oss.sonatype.org/</nexusUrl>
        <autoReleaseAfterClose>true</autoReleaseAfterClose>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
    ...
  </plugins>
</build>
----

The above configurations will get the user account details to deploy to
OSSRH from your Maven settings.xml file. A minimal settings with the
authentication is

[source,xml]
----
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>ossrh</id>
      <username>your-jira-id</username>
      <password>your-jira-pwd</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
----

Note how the id element in the server element in settings.xml is
identical to the id elements in the snapshotRepository and repository
element as well as the serverId configuration of the Nexus Staging Maven
plugin

===== GPG signed components

The Maven GPG plugin is used to sign the components with the following
configuration.

[source,xml]
----
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-gpg-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>1.5</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>sign-artifacts</id>
          <phase>verify</phase>
          <goals>
            <goal>sign</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
----

It relies on the gpg command being installed and the GPG credentials
being available e.g. from settings.xml. In addition you can configure
the gpg command in case it is different from gpg. This is a common
scenario on some operating systems.

[source,xml]
----
<settings>
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>ossrh</id>
      <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
      </activation>
      <properties>
        <gpg.executable>gpg2</gpg.executable>
        <gpg.passphrase>the_pass_phrase</gpg.passphrase>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
</settings>
----

== Releasing artifacts

=== Nexus Staging Maven Plugin for Deployment and Release

The Nexus Staging Maven Plugin is the recommended way to deploy your
components to OSSRH and release them to the Central Repository. To
configure it simply add the plugin to your Maven pom.xml.

[source,xml]
----
<build>
    <plugins>
        ...
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.sonatype.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>nexus-staging-maven-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>1.6.7</version>
          <extensions>true</extensions>
          <configuration>
             <serverId>ossrh</serverId>
             <nexusUrl>https://oss.sonatype.org/</nexusUrl>
             <autoReleaseAfterClose>true</autoReleaseAfterClose>
          </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
<build>
----

=== Update the project version number

We need to update the project version number using the versions Maven
plugin. To do this, cd into the smooks-parent directory and execute the
following command.

....
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=newVersionGoesHere
....

If all looks good then you can remove the backup files using:

....
mvn versions:commit
....

And if you are not happy you can revert using:

....
mvn versions:revert
....

=== Nexus Staging Maven Plugin for Deployment and Release

If your version is a release version (does not end in -SNAPSHOT) and
with this setup in place, you can run a deployment to OSSRH and an
automated release to the Central Repository with the usual:

....
mvn clean deploy -P deploy
....

Please note that the `deploy` profile should be used to enable
`javadoc`, `gpg`, and `nexus-staging` build plugins.

==== Deploy artifacts from a Linux type OS (including Mac OSX)

Simple run:

....
 ./deploy.sh -u <repo-username> -p <repo-password> -g <passphrase-of-gpg-key>
....

=== Build Promotion with the Nexus Staging Suite

First of all become familiar with release staging process:
http://books.sonatype.com/nexus-book/reference/staging.html[Improved
Releases with Staging]

Log in into https://oss.sonatype.org[Nexus repository] (using Sonatype
Jira account) and inspect staging repository which was created (id of
the repository should be printed in the output of the
`maven clean deploy` build). From there, take a look at the “Staging
Repository”. The staging repository is where you can inspect what was
uploaded and make sure that everything looks peachy. If it doesn't, you
can drop the repository and fix the issue and deploy again. Once you
think everything is in order you need to “*Close*” the repository.
Closing will run a number of verification rules, among them verifying
the signatures of the artifacts. Again if something fails you must fix
and the drop and deploy again. If successful, the artifacts are now
available from the staging repository. From there, people will be able
to test these artifacts. If all goes well (no bugs etc), you should now
be able to release the artifacts using the “*Release*” button. This will
make the artifacts available first on the local nexus which will later
sync to maven central.

==== Tag the release

....
git tag -s vx.x.x <commit_SHA_of_the_prepare_release> -m "Tagging vx.x.x”
....

Optionally verify the tag:

....
git tag -v vx.x.x
....

Push the tag:

....
git push upstream vx.x.x
....

=== Prepare for next development iteration

Once tagging is complete, update the versions in the project POM files
for the next release (if necessary). The instructions for doing this
(using the *versions* plugin) are outlined above in section titled
"*Update the project version number*".

== Deploy artifacts from a Docker container

We use Docker to build and deploy artifacts. The main benefits of this
are that it:

. Guarantees a consistent, repeatable build environment.
. Means we can easily build and deploy from an IaaS instance
(AWS/Rackspace/etc) instance.

Assuming you have Docker installed on the local host system, we install
the `smooks` image:

....
sudo docker build -t smooks github.com/smooks/smooks
....

Once the image is built we can kick off the `deploy.sh` script:

....
sudo docker run -i -v $HOME/.gnupg:/.gnupg smooks ./deploy.sh -u <repo-username> -p <repo-password> -g <passphrase-of-gpg-key>
....

You might notice the `-v $HOME/.gnupg:/.gnupg` parameter in the docker
run command. That is mounting the host system's `~/.gnupg` directory
into the docker container as the root account's `~/.gnupg` directory so
the GPG plugin can sign the artifacts using the GPG key generated above.

If you are running the deploy from an IaaS instance (AWS/Rackspace/etc),
you can generate and publish a new GPG key on the IaaS instance.
Alternatively, you might want to export/import your GPG from your local
machine to the IaaS instance. This is easy.

We start by listing the keys on the local machine as follows:

....
$ gpg --list-keys
<HOME>/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
-----------------------------------
pub   2048R/234A1231 2014-05-24 [expires: 2018-05-24]
uid                  TOM FENNELLY <tom.fennelly@gmail.com>
sub   2048R/ABC12345 2014-05-24 [expires: 2018-05-24]
....

Then, we export the public and secret keys and copy them to the IaaS
instance:

....
$ gpg --output pubkey.gpg --armor --export 234A1231
$ gpg --output secretkey.gpg --armor --export-secret-key 234A1231
$ scp pubkey.gpg secretkey.gpg root@<iaas-host-ip>:~/
....

And finally, on the IaaS host instance, we import the keys we just
copied to it:

....
$ gpg --import pubkey.gpg
$ gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import secretkey.gpg
....

Of course you can check the import by running `gpg --list-keys` on the
IaaS host instance. Now your docker IaaS host instance has your GPG keys
installed and you can execute the docker run command to deploy the
artifacts to the Codehaus maven repo.
