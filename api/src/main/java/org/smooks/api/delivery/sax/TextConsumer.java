/**
 * Fragment Text Consumer {@link org.smooks.api.resource.visitor.sax.ng.SaxNgVisitor} Annotation.
 * <p/>
 * Because SAX is a streaming model, you need to tell Smooks to accumulate text events
 * for a specific fragment.  For performance reasons, Smooks would never accumulate these
 * events by default, because that could result in a significant memory/performance overhead.
 * <p/>
 * This annotation results in {@link SAXElement#accumulateText() text accumulation}
 * being turned on for the fragment targeted by the annotated {@link org.smooks.api.resource.visitor.sax.ng.SaxNgVisitor} instance.
 * The text event data can then be accessed through the parent {@link SAXElement} instance.
